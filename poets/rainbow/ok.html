            I stood in front of a mirror <br>
            I stood there everyday <br>
            Yet I never felt nearer  <br>
            Not even halfway <br>
            <br>
            My sight never became clearer <br>
            The vision would breakaway <br>
            Had my memory turned into an Alzheimer? <br>
            That mirror turned me into a throwaway <br>
            <br>
            I thought me and that mirror were dimer <br>
            Had I truly been a stowaway? <br>
            Nothing but the primer for the abuserâ€¦ <br>
            But I became the absorber of the accusor <br>
            <br>
            I would ask away <br>
            "OK" was the response of the mirror-agitator <br>
