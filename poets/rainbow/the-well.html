            The well stands atop the hill <br>
            It's beautiful and freshly built <br>
            I am the first to use it <br>
            I let no one else near it <br>
            <br>
            Often the bucket was empty <br>
            Sometimes it returned jagged <br>
            Other times it refused to return <br>
            That annoyed me <br>
            I gave the well a kick or two <br>
            All the scolding water came back up <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes water would return <br>
            Rare but possible <br>
            I was excited every time <br>
            Butâ€™s been so long since that last happened <br>
            Were these mere illusions? <br>
