            Cherry-lipt Adonis in his snowie shape, <br>
            Might not compare with his pure ivorie white, <br>
            On whose faire front a poet’s pen may write, <br>
        Whose roseate red excels the crimson grape, <br>
        His love-enticing delicate soft limbs, <br>
            Are rarely fram’d t’intrap poore gazine eies: <br>
            His cheeks, the lillie and carnation dies, <br>
        With lovely tincture which Apollo’s dims. <br>
        His lips ripe strawberries in nectar wet, <br>
            His mouth a Hive, his tongue a hony-combe, <br>
            Where Muses (like bees) make their mansion. <br>
        His teeth pure pearle in blushing correll set. <br>
            Oh how can such a body sinne-procuring, <br>
            Be slow to love, and quicke to hate, enduring? <br>
