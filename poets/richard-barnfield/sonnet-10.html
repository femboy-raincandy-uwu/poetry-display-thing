            THus was my loue, thus was my Ganymed, <br>
            (Heauens ioy, worlds wonder, natures fairest work, <br>
            In whose aspect Hope and Dispaire doe lurke) <br>
            Made of pure blood in whitest snow yshed, <br>
            And for sweete Venus only form'd his face, <br>
            And his each member delicately framed, <br>
            And last of all faire Ganymede him named, <br>
            His limbs (as their Creatrix) her imbrace. <br>
            But as for his pure, spotles, vertuous minde, <br>
            Because it sprung of chaste Dianaes blood, <br>
            (Goddesse of Maides, directresse of all good,) <br>
            Hit wholy is to chastity inclinde. <br>
            And thus it is: as far as I can proue, <br>
            He loues to be beloued, but not to loue. <br>
