            Sometimes I wish that I his pillow were, <br>
            So might I steale a kisse, and yet not seene, <br>
            So might I gaze upon his'sleeping eine, <br>
            Although I did it with a panting feare: <br>
            But when I well consider how vain my wish is, <br>
            Ah foolish Bees (thinke I) that doe not sucke <br>
            His lips for hony; but poore flowers doe plucke <br>
            Which haue no sweet in them: when his sole kisses, <br>
            Are able to reuiue a dying soule. <br>
            Kisse him, but sting him not, for if you doe, <br>
            His angry voice your flying will pursue: <br>
            But when they heare his tongue, what can controule <br>
            Their back-returne? for then they plaine may see <br>
            How hony-combs from his lips dropping bee. <br>
