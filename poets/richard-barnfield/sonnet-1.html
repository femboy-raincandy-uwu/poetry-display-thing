            Sporting at fancy, setting light by love, <br>
There came a thief, and stole away my heart <br>
(And therefore robbed me of my chiefest part): <br>
Yet cannot Reason him a felon prove. <br>

For why? His beauty (my heart’s thief) affirmeth, <br>
Piercing no skin (the body’s sensitive wall) <br>
And having leave, and free consent withal, <br>
Himself not guilty, whom Love guilty termeth. <br>

Conscience the judge, twelve Reasons are the jury, <br>
They find mine eyes the beauty to have let in, <br>
And on this verdict given, agreed they been: <br>
Wherefore, because his beauty did allure ye, <br>

Your doom is this: in tears still to be drowned, <br>
When his fair forehead with disdain is frowned. <br>
