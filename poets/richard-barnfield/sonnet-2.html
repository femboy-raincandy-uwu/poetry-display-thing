            Beauty and Maiesty are falne at ods, <br>
            Th' one claimes his cheeke, the other claimes his chin; <br>
            Then Vertue comes, and puts her title in. <br>
            (Quoth she) I make him like th' immortall Gods. <br>
            (Quoth Maiestie) I owne his lookes, his Brow, <br>
            His lips (quoth Loue), his eies, his faire is mine. <br>
            And yet (quoth Maiesty) he is not thine, <br>
            I mixe Disdaine with Loue's congealed Snow. <br>
            I, but (quoth Loue) his lockes are mine (by right), <br>
            His stately gate is mine (quoth Maiestie), <br>
            And mine (quoth Vertue) is his Modestie. <br>
            Thus as they striue about the heauenly wight, <br>
            At last the other two to Vertue yeeld <br>
            The lists of Loue, fought in faire Beauties field. <br>
