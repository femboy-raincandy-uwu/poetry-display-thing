            It is reported of faire Thetis' Sonne <br>
            (Achilles famous for his chiualry, <br>
            His noble minde and magnanimitie), <br>
            That when the Troian wars were new begun, <br>
            Whos'euer was deepe-wounded with his speare, <br>
            Could neuer be recured of his maime, <br>
            Nor euer after be made whole againe: <br>
            Except with that speares rust he holpen were. <br>
            Euen so it fareth with my fortune now, <br>
            Who being wounded with his piercing eie, <br>
            Must either thereby finde a remedy, <br>
            Or els to be releeu'd I know not how. <br>
            Then if thou hast a minde still to annoy me, <br>
            Kill me with kisses, if thou wilt destroy me. <br>
