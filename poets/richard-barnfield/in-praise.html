            If music and sweet poetry agree, <br>
            As they must needs (the sister and the brother), <br>
            Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me, <br>
                Because thou lov'st the one, and I the other. <br>
                Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch <br>
            Upon the lute doth ravish human sense; <br>
            Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such <br>
                As, passing all conceit, needs no defence. <br>
                Thou lov'st to hear the sweet melodious sound <br>
            That Ph{oe}bus' lute (the queen of music), makes; <br>
            And I in deep delight am chiefly drown'd <br>
            Whenas himself to singing he betakes. <br>
                One god is god of both (as poets feign), <br>
                One knight loves both, and both in thee remain. <br>
