            Chaucer is dead; and Gower lies in grave; <br>
            The Earl of Surrey long ago is gone; <br>
            Sir Philip Sidney's soul the heavens have; <br>
            George Gascoigne him before was tombed in stone. <br>
            Yet, though their bodies lie full low in ground, <br>
            As every thing must die that erst was born, <br>
            Their living fame no fortune can confound, <br>
            Nor ever shall their labors be forlorn. <br>
            And you, that discommend sweet poetry, <br>
            (So that the subject of the same be good) <br>
            Here may you see your fond simplicity, <br>
            Sith kings have favored it, of royal blood. <br>
            The King of Scots (now living) is a poet, <br>
            As his Lepanto and his Furies show it. <br>
