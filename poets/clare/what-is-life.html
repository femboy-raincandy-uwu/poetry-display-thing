          <p>
            And what is Life?—An hour-glass on the run, <br>
            A Mist retreating from the morning sun, <br>
                A busy, bustling, still repeated dream; <br>
            Its length?—A minute's pause, a moment's thought; <br>
                And happiness?—A bubble on the stream, <br>
            That in the act of seizing shrinks to nought. <br>
            <br>
            What are vain Hopes?—The puffing gale of morn, <br>
                That of its charms divests the dewy lawn, <br>
            And robs each flow'ret of its gem,—and dies; <br>
                A cobweb hiding disappointment's thorn, <br>
            Which stings more keenly through the thin disguise. <br>
            <br>
            And thou, O Trouble?—nothing can suppose, <br>
            (And sure the power of wisdom only knows,) <br>
                What need requireth thee: <br>
            So free and liberal as thy bounty flows, <br>
                Some necessary cause must surely be: <br>
            But disappointments, pains, and every woe <br>
                Devoted wretches feel, <br>
            The universal plagues of life below, <br>
                Are mysteries still 'neath Fate's unbroken seal. <br>
                <br>
            And what is Death? is still the cause unfound? <br>
            That dark, mysterious name of horrid sound?— <br>
                A long and lingering sleep, the weary crave. <br>
            And Peace? where can its happiness abound?— <br>
                No where at all, save heaven, and the grave. <br>
                <br>
            Then what is Life?—When stripp'd of its disguise, <br>
                A thing to be desir'd it cannot be; <br>
            Since every thing that meets our foolish eyes <br>
                Gives proof sufficient of its vanity. <br>
            'Tis but a trial all must undergo; <br>
                To teach unthankful mortals how to prize <br>
            That happiness vain man's denied to know, <br>
                Until he's call'd to claim it in the skies. <br>
