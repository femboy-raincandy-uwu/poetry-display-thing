            I am! yet what I am who cares, or knows? <br>
            My friends forsake me like a memory lost.  <br>
       I am the self-consumer of my woes,  <br>
            They rise and vanish, an oblivious host,  <br>
       Shadows of life, whose very soul is lost. <br>
       And yet I am—I live—though I am toss'd  <br>
       <br>
       Into the nothingness of scorn and noise,  <br>
            Into the living sea of waking dream,  <br>
       Where there is neither sense of life, nor joys,  <br>
            But the huge shipwreck of my own esteem <br>
       And all that's dear. Even those I loved the best  <br>
       Are strange—nay, they are stranger than the rest.  <br>
       <br>
       I long for scenes where man has never trod,  <br>
            For scenes where woman never smiled or wept;  <br>
       There to abide with my Creator, God,  <br>
            And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept  <br>
       Full of high thoughts, unborn. So let me lie,   <br>
       The grass below; above the vaulted sky. <br>
