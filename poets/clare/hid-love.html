          <p>
            I hid my love when young till I <br>
            Couldn't bear the buzzing of a fly; <br>
            I hid my love to my despite <br>
            Till I could not bear to look at light: <br>
            I dare not gaze upon her face <br>
            But left her memory in each place; <br>
            Where'er I saw a wild flower lie <br>
            I kissed and bade my love good-bye. <br>
            <br>
            I met her in the greenest dells, <br>
            Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells; <br>
            The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye, <br>
            The bee kissed and went singing by, <br>
            A sunbeam found a passage there, <br>
            A gold chain round her neck so fair; <br>
            As secret as the wild bee's song <br>
            She lay there all the summer long. <br>
            <br>
            I hid my love in field and town <br>
            Till e'en the breeze would knock me down; <br>
            The bees seemed singing ballads o'er, <br>
            The fly's bass turned a lion's roar; <br>
            And even silence found a tongue, <br>
            To haunt me all the summer long; <br>
            The riddle nature could not prove <br>
            Was nothing else but secret love. <br>
