              <p>
               All Kings, and all their favourites, <br>
               All glory of honours, beauties, wits, <br>
          The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass, <br>
          Is elder by a year now than it was <br>
          When thou and I first one another saw: <br>
          All other things to their destruction draw, <br>
               Only our love hath no decay; <br>
          This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday, <br>
          Running it never runs from us away, <br>
       But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day. <br>
       <br>
               Two graves must hide thine and my corse; <br>
               If one might, death were no divorce. <br>
          Alas, as well as other Princes, we <br>
          (Who Prince enough in one another be) <br>
          Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears, <br>
          Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears; <br>
               But souls where nothing dwells but love <br>
          (All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove <br>
          This, or a love increasèd there above, <br>
       When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove. <br>
       <br>
               And then we shall be throughly blessed; <br>
               But we no more than all the rest. <br>
          Here upon earth we’re Kings, and none but we <br>
          Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be; <br>
          Who is so safe as we? where none can do <br>
          Treason to us, except one of us two. <br>
               True and false fears let us refrain, <br>
          Let us love nobly, and live, and add again <br>
          Years and years unto years, till we attain <br>
       To write threescore: this is the second of our reign. <br>
