            I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I <br>
            Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then? <br>
            But sucked on country pleasures, childishly? <br>
            Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers’ den? <br>
            ’Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be. <br>
            If ever any beauty I did see, <br>
            Which I desired, and got, ’twas but a dream of thee. <br>
            <br>
            And now good-morrow to our waking souls, <br>
            Which watch not one another out of fear; <br>
            For love, all love of other sights controls, <br>
            And makes one little room an everywhere. <br>
            Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone, <br>
            Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown, <br>
            Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one. <br>
            <br>
            My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears, <br>
            And true plain hearts do in the faces rest; <br>
            Where can we find two better hemispheres, <br>
            Without sharp north, without declining west? <br>
            Whatever dies, was not mixed equally; <br>
            If our two loves be one, or, thou and I <br>
            Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die. <br>
