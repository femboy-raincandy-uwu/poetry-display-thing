            I am two fools, I know, <br>
            For loving, and for saying so <br>
                In whining poetry; <br>
      But where's that wiseman, that would not be I, <br>
                If she would not deny? <br>
      Then as th' earth's inward narrow crooked lanes <br>
          Do purge sea water's fretful salt away, <br>
      I thought, if I could draw my pains <br>
          Through rhyme's vexation, I should them allay. <br>
      Grief brought to numbers cannot be so fierce, <br>
      For he tames it, that fetters it in verse. <br>
      <br>
            But when I have done so, <br>
            Some man, his art and voice to show, <br>
                Doth set and sing my pain; <br>
      And, by delighting many, frees again <br>
                Grief, which verse did restrain. <br>
      To love and grief tribute of verse belongs, <br>
          But not of such as pleases when 'tis read. <br>
      Both are increased by such songs, <br>
          For both their triumphs so are published, <br>
      And I, which was two fools, do so grow three; <br>
      Who are a little wise, the best fools be. <br>
