          <p>
            Here take my picture; though I bid farewell <br>
            Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell. <br>
            'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more <br>
            When we are shadows both, than 'twas before. <br>
            When weather-beaten I come back, my hand <br>
            Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd, <br>
            My face and breast of haircloth, and my head <br>
            With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread, <br>
            My body'a sack of bones, broken within, <br>
            And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin; <br>
            If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man <br>
            So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then, <br>
            This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say, <br>
            "Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay? <br>
            Or do they reach his judging mind, that he <br>
            Should now love less, what he did love to see? <br>
            That which in him was fair and delicate, <br>
            Was but the milk which in love's childish state <br>
            Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough <br>
            To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough." <br>
