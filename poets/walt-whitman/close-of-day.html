            When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv’d with plaudits in the capitol, still it was not a happy night for me that follow’d, <br>
            And else when I carous’d, or when my plans were accomplish’d, still I was not <br>
            happy, <br>
            But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh’d, singing, inhaling the ripe breath of autumn, <br>
            When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the <br>
            morning light, <br>
            When I wander’d alone over the beach, and undressing bathed, laughing with the cool waters, and saw the sun rise, <br>
            And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming, O <br>
            then I was happy, <br>
            O then each breath tasted sweeter, and all that day my food nourish’d me more, and the beautiful day pass’d well, <br>
            And the next came with equal joy, and with the next at evening came my <br>
            friend, <br>
            And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up
            <br>the shores, <br>
            I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me, <br>
            For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool <br>
            night, <br>
            In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me, <br>
            And his arm lay lightly around my breast – and that night I was happy. <br>
