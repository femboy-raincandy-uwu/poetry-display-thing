        <h3>Life Summary</h3>
        <p>Walt Whitman (1819–1892) was a pioneering American poet whose work celebrated democracy and the human body. His seminal collection, Leaves of Grass, broke literary conventions with its candid exploration of both heterosexual and homoerotic themes. The "Calamus" poems, in particular, express deep affection between men, leading many scholars to interpret them as reflections of Whitman's own same-sex attractions. While Whitman never publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, he had close relationships with men like Peter Doyle, and his writings suggest a profound emotional and possibly physical intimacy with male companions. Despite societal taboos of his era, Whitman's poetry boldly embraced the full spectrum of human love and desire, solidifying his legacy as a foundational figure in both American literature and queer history.
